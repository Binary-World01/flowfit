## **How to View:**

1. **Server is already running** on `http://localhost:8000`
2. Open your browser and go to:
   - `http://localhost:8000/welcome.html` - Start here!
   - `http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html` - Main dashboard
   - `http://localhost:8000/scanner.html` - Scanner interface
   - `http://localhost:8000/achievements.html` - Badges
   - `http://localhost:8000/profile.html` - Profile settings
   - `http://localhost:8000/insights.html` - Analytics

## **Next Steps:**

The UI is now **100% complete** and matches your reference designs! 

You can now:
- ✅ Add JavaScript functionality to the pages
- ✅ Connect to APIs (Clarifai for scanning, USDA for nutrition)
- ✅ Integrate Firebase for authentication
- ✅ Add camera capture functionality
- ✅ Make the charts interactive

All the styling is done - you just need to wire up the backend! 🚀

**Note:** The old `index.html` still exists with the original design. I created a redirect file `index-redirect.html` that redirects to `welcome.html` if you want to use that as your entry point.
